* Announcing yourself for hire
** Taxonomy

More interesting:
* vouching for someone else

1st phase:
----------
* user tweets with #frhire
* frhire sees tweet and parses
* frhire creates "profile" page with twitter public info and #frhire tweet stream
* first time, create @reply for user with a link to their profile
* attempt to find user's linked in profile and let user verify
* let a user claim their profile by logging into twitter using oauth
* advertising ($)
* possible marketing/ads through strategic partners ($)
* send out a tweet asking your friends to vouch for you
* send out a tweet asking your friends to recommend you on LinkedIn

with a user account, user can add:
* resume link
* full name
* description
* other links
* location

2nd phase:
----------
* allow a user to be able to create an account that's "private", but available via search anonymously
* enable a user to be contacted via the site (via twitter DM) ($)
* affiliate sales for things that are useful for people looking for a job ($)


Vouching mechanism:
-------------------
* RT of #frhire post
* how do we assign value/verifiability to the vouching
* LinkedIn recommendations and tweeting it with #frhire and user's @twitter name
* user can construct a tweet that lists the recommendation from LinkedIn with a link to the LinkedIn profile


Distribution lists:
-------------------
* Let users sign up for email alerts when certain criteria are discovered ($)


Search for talent:
------------------
* make it easy for people to promote themselves
* claimed profiles can pay to appear in a paid-for section of the search system
* user can pay to appear ahead of non-paying profiles, with bolder/more prominent listing (with user photo) ($)


--------------------
TODO:
* top nav like LinkedIn - Candidates  Jobs  Search
* Featured Seekers/Featured Jobs boxes  (on the right) 


DONE:
* something like Twitscoop - tweets down the middle... nice little search cloud on the right
* Nice search box like linked in
* On Candidate and Jobs pages - ads to the right like Google
